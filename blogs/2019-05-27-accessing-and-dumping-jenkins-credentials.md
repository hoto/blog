Most pipelines requires secrets to authenticate with some external resources.  
All secrets should live outside of our code repository and should be fed directly into the pipeline.   
Jenkins offers a credentials store where we can keep our secrets and access them from jobs.

## Credentials storage

I did not use the word "secure" anywhere in the introduction because the way any CI server stores credentials is by nature insecure.

CI servers cannot use one-way hashes (like bcrypt) to encode secrets because when requested by the pipeline those secrets needs to be restored back into their original form.  
One-way hashes are then out of the picture, what's left is two-way encryption.  
This means two things:
1. Anyone with "Create jobs" permissions can view secrets in plain form.
2. Jenkins encrypts secrets at rest but keeps the decryption key somewhere on its host.

You may be wondering why Jenkins even bother encrypting the secrets if they can be retrieved just by asking.
The only reasonable idea that comes to my mind is that Jenkins creators wanted to make it a little bit harder to gain access to plain format secrets when the attacker gains ssh access to the Jenkins host.

However, using credentials store is infinitely better then keeping secrets in the project repository.  
Later in this post I will talk about what can be done to minimize the secrets leakage from Jenkins.

## Creating credentials

If you want to follow this post and run the examples yourself, you can spin up a pre-made Jenkins instance from my [jenkinsfile-examples][0] repository in less then 1min (depending on your bandwidth):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoto/jenkinsfile-examples.git
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up
```

Open `localhost:8080` where you should see a Jenkins with a couple of jobs.

To browse and add secrets click on `Credentials`.  
My Jenkins instance already have some pre-made credentials.

To add secrets hover over `(global)` to show a â–¼ sign and click on it.  
Select `Add credentials` where you can finally add secrets.

If you want you can add more secrets, but I will be using the already pre-made secrets.

Now that we've covered creating credentials let's move on to accessing them from a `Jenkinsfile`.

## Secrets access from a Jenkinsfile

We will be focusing on job `130-accessing-credentials`. 

![](./images/2019-05-27-accessing-and-dumping-jenkins-credentials/005.png)

Job `130-accessing-credentials` has a following [Jenkinsfile][1]:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {

    stage('usernamePassword') {
      steps {
        script {
          withCredentials([
            usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'gitlab',
              usernameVariable: 'username',
              passwordVariable: 'password')
          ]) {
            print 'username=' + username + 'password=' + password

            print 'username.collect { it }=' + username.collect { it }
            print 'password.collect { it }=' + password.collect { it }
          }
        }
      }
    }

    stage('usernameColonPassword') {
      steps {
        script {
          withCredentials([
            usernameColonPassword(
              credentialsId: 'gitlab',
              variable: 'userpass')
          ]) {
            print 'userpass=' + userpass
            print 'userpass.collect { it }=' + userpass.collect { it }
          }
        }
      }
    }

    stage('string (secret text)') {
      steps {
        script {
          withCredentials([
            string(
              credentialsId: 'joke-of-the-day',
              variable: 'joke')
          ]) {
            print 'joke=' + joke
            print 'joke.collect { it }=' + joke.collect { it }
          }
        }
      }
    }

    stage('sshUserPrivateKey') {
      steps {
        script {
          withCredentials([
            sshUserPrivateKey(
              credentialsId: 'production-bastion',
              keyFileVariable: 'keyFile',
              passphraseVariable: 'passphrase',
              usernameVariable: 'username')
          ]) {
            print 'keyFile=' + keyFile
            print 'passphrase=' + passphrase
            print 'username=' + username
            print 'keyFile.collect { it }=' + keyFile.collect { it }
            print 'passphrase.collect { it }=' + passphrase.collect { it }
            print 'username.collect { it }=' + username.collect { it }
            print 'keyFileContent=' + readFile(keyFile)
          }
        }
      }
    }

    stage('dockerCert') {
      steps {
        script {
          withCredentials([
            dockerCert(
              credentialsId: 'production-docker-ee-certificate',
              variable: 'DOCKER_CERT_PATH')
          ]) {
            print 'DOCKER_CERT_PATH=' + DOCKER_CERT_PATH
            print 'DOCKER_CERT_PATH.collect { it }=' + DOCKER_CERT_PATH.collect { it }
            print 'DOCKER_CERT_PATH/ca.pem=' + readFile("$DOCKER_CERT_PATH/ca.pem")
            print 'DOCKER_CERT_PATH/cert.pem=' + readFile("$DOCKER_CERT_PATH/cert.pem")
            print 'DOCKER_CERT_PATH/key.pem=' + readFile("$DOCKER_CERT_PATH/key.pem")
          }
        }
      }
    }

    stage('list credentials ids') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'cat $JENKINS_HOME/credentials.xml | grep "<id>"'
        }
      }
    }

  }
}
```

All examples for different types of secrets can be found in the official Jenkins [documentation][2]

Running the job and checking the logs uncovers that Jenkins tries to redact the secrets from the build log by matching for secrets values and replacing them with stars `****`.  
We can see the actual secret values if we print them in such a way that a simple match and replace won't work.  

Code:
```groovy
print 'username.collect { it }=' + username.collect { it }
```
Log output:
```
username.collect { it }=[g, i, t, l, a, b, a, d, m, i, n]
```

In this case each character is printed separately and Jenkins does not redact the values.

> Anyone with write access to a repository built on Jenkins can uncover all `Global` credentials by modifying a `Jenkinsfile`.

> Anyone with "create job" privileges can uncover all `Global` secrets by creating a pipeline job.

### Listing ids of secrets

You can list all credentials ids by listing the `$JENKINS_HOME/credentials.xml` file.

Code:
```groovy
stage('list credentials ids') {
  steps {
    script {
      sh 'cat $JENKINS_HOME/credentials.xml | grep "<id>"'
    }
  }
}
```
Log output:
``` 
+ cat /var/jenkins_home/credentials.xml
+ grep <id>
          <id>gitlab</id>
          <id>production-bastion</id>
          <id>joke-of-the-day</id>
          <id>production-docker-ee-certificate</id>
```

## Accessing `System` and other credential values 

Jenkins has two types of credentials: `Global` and `System`.

`Global` are accessible
