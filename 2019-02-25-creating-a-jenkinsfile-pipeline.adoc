== Creating Multibranch Pipeline Job

If you want to follow this article but don’t have a Jenkins instance at hand you can use my GitHub project to spin up a dockerized Jenkins:

....
git clone https://github.com/hoto/jenkinsfile-examples.git
cd jenkinsfile-examples
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up
....

Let’s open Jenkins by going to `localhost:8080`

There are already a couple of jobs there but ignore them as we will be creating a new job.

=== Creating new job

Click on `New Item` to open a job creation wizard.
