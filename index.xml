This article expands on how to use https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[Jenkins Shared Libraries] with private git repositories, semantically version and unit test your libraries and provides working examples which you can run yourself. .Photo by https://unsplash.com/photos/GWOTvo3qq7U?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText[j zamora] on https://unsplash.com/search/photos/library?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText[Unsplash] image::001.jpeg[] == Short Intro Jenkins Shared Library is a very useful tool when dealing with multiple similar pipelines.</description>

Your files on laptop may be encrypted and safe but what about the files on pendrives you use? Removing a file from unencrypted pendrive does not make it impossible to retrieve it. Encrypt a pendrive and you can be always safe.</description>

In this part of the series we will encrypt the two out of four partitions we created in the previous episode. For encryption we will use https://linux.die.net/man/8/cryptsetup[`cryptsetup`] .

We want to encrypt partitions for our binaries `/dev/sda3` and for our home `/dev/sda4` .</description>

We still need to configure https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/crypttab.html[`crypttab`] to decrypt two partitions automatically during boot. Our current situation is: when the laptop boots up and we provide encryption password it only unlocks the `/dev/sda3` partition.</description>
